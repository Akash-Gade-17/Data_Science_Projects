# Milk Quality Prediction 
The Milk Quality Prediction project is aimed at leveraging machine learning techniques to assess and predict the quality of milk based on various attributes and parameters. This project holds great significance in the dairy industry, where maintaining the quality of milk is crucial to ensure consumer safety and satisfaction. By developing an accurate predictive model, dairy farmers and milk processing units can take proactive measures to maintain and improve milk quality.

## Problem Statement 
In the dairy industry, ensuring the quality of milk is paramount to meet consumer expectations, adhere to regulatory standards and maintain a profitable operation. However, assessing milk quality can be a complex and time-consuming process, often relying on manual inspections and outdated methods. The problem lies in the need for a more efficient and accurate way to evaluate milk quality.

Build a model that will classify quality of milk into 3 types i.e. low, medium & high. Use different classifiers, calculate their accuracy & state which Model will be fit for classification of " Quality of Milk ".
