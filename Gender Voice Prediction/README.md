# Gender Voice Prediction

This project is all about the prediction of gender based on voice. It can have several practical applications. It can be used in fields such as speech recognition systems, call center analytics, voice-based virtual assistants and even forensic investigations. By accurately predicting gender from voice samples, organizations can tailor their services and products to better meet the needs of specific customer segments or enhance the efficiency of voice-based systems.


## Problem Statement
Aim is to develop a robust model capable of predicting the gender of an individual based on voice-related features. Voice data, such as pitch, frequency and other acoustic attributes, will serve as our primary dataset. The objective is to create a machine learning model, particularly employing the Random Forest Classifier, to make accurate gender predictions from voice characteristics.
