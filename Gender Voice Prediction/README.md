This project is all about the prediction of gender based on voice. It can have several practical applications. It can be used in fields such as speech recognition systems, call center analytics, voice-based virtual assistants and even forensic investigations. By accurately predicting gender from voice samples, organizations can tailor their services and products to better meet the needs of specific customer segments or enhance the efficiency of voice-based systems.
