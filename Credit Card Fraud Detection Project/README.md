##  Dataset
We used the Kaggle dataset
[Credit Card Fraud Detection data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Techniques:
* Logistic Regression
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

## Conclusion :
The Credit Fraud Detection project successfully implemented and evaluated various classification models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. In this project we have used Logistic Regression,K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier,Random Forest Classifier. Amongst all Logistic Regression Model demonstrated promising performance with high accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score. The model's effectiveness in minimizing financial losses and ensuring customer trust makes it valuable for real-world credit card security applications.
